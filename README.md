CRUD Project
This project explains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using spring boot and H2 in-memory database. In this app we are using Spring Data JPA for built-in methods to do CRUD operations.
@EnableJpaRepositories annotation is used on main class to Enable H2 DB related configuration, which will read properties from application.properties file.
